# computer-programming-II
Some pratical with algorithms and data structures to practice for the exam of Computer Programming II (Lab). 
The course program covers the following topics:
  - Dictionary
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Double-ended Queue
  - List

I passed the exam Lab20150203. My project was rated 30/30 with honors.
My first projects may have some bugs. Surely, in many of them, my code was not yet at a good level.
Notify to me all bugs.
